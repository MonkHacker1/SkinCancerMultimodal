=== Skin Cancer Diagnosis Report ===
Date: May 10, 2025
Model: MultimodalSkinCancerModel (Ensemble of 4 folds, Test Accuracy: 0.9592)

=== Patient and Lesion Information ===
Image Analyzed: /content/drive/MyDrive/Data-Set/images/imgs_part_3/PAT_2127_4662_596.png
Clinical Metadata:
  - Age: -1.04 (normalized)
  - Gender: Male
  - Fitzpatrick Skin Type: 3.0
  - Lesion Location: Back
  - Lesion Diameter: -0.18 x -0.12 mm (normalized)
  - Symptoms: Itch, Growth observed, Pain, Morphological changes noted, Bleeding
  - Risk Factors: None reported
  - Other: No smoking, no alcohol consumption, no pesticide exposure

=== Diagnostic Prediction ===
Predicted Lesion Type: NEV
Confidence Probabilities:
  - BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma): 0.0720
  - SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma): 0.0535
  - MEL (Melanoma): 0.0746
  - ACK (Actinic Keratosis): 0.0280
  - NEV (Nevus): 0.7061
  - SEK (Seborrheic Keratosis): 0.0659

=== Clinical Interpretation ===
Based on the ensemble analysis of the provided dermoscopic image and clinical metadata, the BioGPT-enhanced multimodal model predicts that the lesion is most likely **NEV** with a confidence of 71% (Note: Confidence below 84%, clinical review recommended). The prediction considers the lesion’s appearance (via image analysis) and clinical factors, including the patient’s age (-1.04, normalized), itch, growth observed, pain, morphological changes noted, bleeding, and none reported. NEV is a precancerous or benign lesion, often presenting as a pigmented mole, and is typically benign but should be monitored.
The probabilities indicate high confidence in NEV, with notable likelihoods for MEL (7%) and BCC (7%), suggesting some visual and clinical overlap among these conditions. The low probability for MEL (7%) reduces the likelihood of melanoma, but clinical vigilance is advised.

=== Recommendations ===
This AI-generated diagnosis is preliminary and should not replace professional medical evaluation. We recommend:
1. Consultation with a dermatologist for a comprehensive clinical assessment, including a biopsy if indicated.
2. Monitoring the lesion for further changes in size, shape, or symptoms.
3. Sun protection measures, given the patient’s Fitzpatrick Skin Type 3.0 and none reported.
